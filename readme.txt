This is Minesweeper! 

To play, pick a difficulty (easy, medium, hard) to generate a board. 
Click once on a tile to uncover it, click while holding down 'f' to flag it.
Once uncovered, any given tile will display the number of mines in the surrounding 8 tiles. 
To win, uncover every tile that is not a mine and cover every mine! 

To run this project, simply run main.py and the game will be launched. 

No libraries need to be installed to run this project. 

If you press or hold 't' while playing, every tile (including mines) will be uncovered. This is for testing/development purposes. 

No special fonts are used or need to be downloaded.
